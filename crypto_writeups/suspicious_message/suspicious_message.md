The main idea is to find the flag is to use playfair chapter.

1. We are given `photo.png` and a message `MQDzqdor{Ix4Oa41W_1F_B00h_m1YlqPpPP}`. We know that the flag format has to be CTFlearn{} and so, I got idea from the `photo.png`.
2. Immediately, I tried for Playfair Cipher at: [http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/playfair.php](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/playfair.php)
3. I used the given parameters and got the flag.
