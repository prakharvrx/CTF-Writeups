The main idea finding the flag is just having knowledge about Vigenere Cipher.

1. Its very easy if you have basic idea of Vigenere Cipher.
```bash
The vignere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.<br />

Iâ€™m not sure what this means, but it was left lying around: blorpy

gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}
```
2. One thing is important to know that Vigenere Cipher requires a **key** to decode any message. I used this URL to decode my message and used given key as : `blorpy` [https://cryptii.com/](https://cryptii.com/)
3. This was my output:

Flag: `flag{CiphersAreAwesome}`
