This challenge is a great introduction to **SQL Injection**, a common web vulnerability where an attacker uses a web form input to execute malicious SQL queries on the backend database. The goal is to bypass a simple name check and reveal hidden data.

## Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance

Upon visiting the URL, we are presented with a simple input form. A quick look at the page's source code reveals a hidden comment:

`<!-- Try some names like Hiroki, Noah, Luke -->`

This comment gives us a hint about what the backend database might be expecting. We can assume the website is checking our input against a list of names in a table.

## Step 2: Performing the SQL Injection

We tried the suggested names, such as "Hiroki," "Noah," and "Luke," but none of these inputs provided the flag. This tells us the flag isn't directly tied to a known name, and we'll need a more advanced technique.

The backend SQL query likely looks something like this:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '[user_input]';`

To get the database to return all rows, we can use a basic SQL injection payload. The most common payload for this type of vulnerability is `' OR '1' = '1`. The single quote `'` breaks out of the string literal, and the `OR '1' = '1'` clause is always true, causing the `WHERE` condition to evaluate as true for every row.

The modified query becomes:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1' = '1';`

## Step 3: Finding the Flag

When we submit the payload `' OR '1' = '1` into the form, the database returns all entries, including the one containing the flag.

The output shows a list of names and associated data:

- `Name: Luke`
- `Data: I made this problem.`
- `...`
- `Name: fl4g__giv3r`
- `Data: th4t_is_why_you_n33d_to_sanitiz3_inputs`
- `...`

The data associated with the `fl4g__giv3r` user is the flag.

## Final Flag

The flag is:

**`th4t_is_why_you_n33d_to_sanitiz3_inputs`**

This challenge highlights the critical importance of **sanitizing user inputs** to prevent malicious code from being executed on a backend database.
