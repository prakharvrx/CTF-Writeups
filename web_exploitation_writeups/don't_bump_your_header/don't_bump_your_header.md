This challenge involves manipulating HTTP headers to bypass security checks on a website. The goal is to figure out which specific headers the server is looking for to reveal the flag.

## Step 1: Initial Investigation

Upon visiting the URL `http://165.227.106.113/header.php`, we are presented with a simple webpage. Since this is a web-based challenge, a good first step is to see how the server responds to different HTTP methods. Using `curl`, we can make a `POST` request.

```
curl -X POST [http://165.227.106.113/header.php](http://165.227.106.113/header.php)
```

The server responds with an error, but it also gives us a crucial hint in an HTML comment:

`Sorry, it seems as if your user agent is not correct, in order to access this website. The one you supplied is: curl/7.68.0<!-- Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt -->`

The comment reveals the specific **User-Agent** string the server is expecting: `Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt`.

## Step 2: Faking the User-Agent

The server is checking the `User-Agent` header, so we need to add that to our `curl` command. We can use the `-H` flag to specify a custom header.

```
curl -H "User-Agent: Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt" [http://165.227.106.113/header.php](http://165.227.106.113/header.php)
```

The server processes our request but gives us another message:

`Sorry, it seems as if you did not just come from the site, "awesomesauce.com".<!-- Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt -->`

This tells us the server is also checking the **Referer** header to ensure the request originated from a specific domain.

## Step 3: Faking the Referer

The server is expecting the `Referer` header to be set to `awesomesauce.com`. We need to add this to our `curl` command as well.

```
curl -H "User-Agent: Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt" -H "Referer: awesomesauce.com" [http://165.227.106.113/header.php](http://165.227.106.113/header.php)
```

With both the correct `User-Agent` and `Referer` headers, the server's security checks are bypassed. The server now returns the flag.

`Here is your flag: flag{did_this_m3ss_with_y0ur_h34d}<!-- Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt -->`

## Final Flag

The flag is:

**`flag{did_this_m3ss_with_y0ur_h34d}`**

This challenge is a great demonstration of how important HTTP headers are for both security and functionality on the web. A server can check for specific headers to determine if a request is valid or not.
