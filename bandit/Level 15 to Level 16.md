Connect using SSH

After connect, We using the `openssl` to connect with localhost at `30001` port number, so we using that command as well `openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001`  so they can tell me to enter the passcode or whatever so first we can go to and copy that strings from here `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15`  and paste into the `openssl` place
