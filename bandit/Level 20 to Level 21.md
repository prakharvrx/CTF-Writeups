To solve Bandit Level 20 to 21, we use the setuid binary `suconnect`, which connects to a port on localhost and checks if the incoming text matches the previous level’s password. Since it will connect to any port we provide, we set up a simple netcat server that listens on a chosen port and sends the password when the binary connects. Using `echo -n 'GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j' | nc -l -p 1234 &`, we start a temporary background server that outputs the correct password. Then we run `./suconnect 1234`, which connects to our server, reads the password, verifies it, and returns the next level's password: `gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr`.
