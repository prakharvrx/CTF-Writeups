The next step begins by creating a temporary directory using `mktemp -d` and moving into it with `cd`. Inside this folder, the repository is cloned from the target Git server using `git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo`, and after entering the `repo` directory, its contents are inspected with normal listing commands. Since the only file on the master branch is a `README.md` that shows `<no passwords in production!>`, you check for additional branches by running `git branch -a`, which reveals extra branches like `dev` and `sploits-dev`. Because the production branch has no password, you switch to the development branch using `git checkout dev`, and once inside this branch, you read the updated README with `cat README.md`, which finally displays the correct password for bandit30.
