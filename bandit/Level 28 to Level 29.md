The process starts by logging into the machine with the SSH command for bandit28 and entering the password. After accessing the level, a temporary directory is created using `mktemp -d`, and then you move into that directory with `cd`. Inside this clean working folder, the Git repository is cloned using `git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo`, and the same bandit28 password is entered when the prompt appears. Once the repository is cloned, you go inside the `repo` folder and view its contents. The `README.md` file is present, but when you open it using `cat README.md`, the password is hidden as `xxxxxxxxxx`. Because Git stores history, the next step is to examine the commit logs using `git log`. Among the commits, one message says “fix info leak,” which clearly hints that the real password was removed at some point. To inspect that older version, the commit is displayed using `git show edd935d60906b33f0619605abd1689808ccdd5ee`, and inside this diff you can see the previous content of the README, including the original password before it was replaced.
