After connect, using `cd /bandit2` to go to the directory `bandit2` and if you can use this command `ls` then you will see the filename `--spaces in this filename--` but the problem you even can't use the normal `cat` command to see the content so you can use this instead `cat -- "--spaces in this filename--"` this command can useful to see the content in the filename of `--spaces in this filename`
