To solve Bandit Level 21 to 22, we inspect the cron jobs located in `/etc/cron.d`, where we find a job named `cronjob_bandit22`. Reading this file shows that a script (`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh`) is executed every minute as user bandit22. Checking the script reveals that it writes the content of `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit22` into a world-readable file inside `/tmp` named `t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`. Since the cronjob runs continuously, the file already exists and contains the password for the next level, which we retrieve with `cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`. This outputs the Bandit22 password: `Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI`.
