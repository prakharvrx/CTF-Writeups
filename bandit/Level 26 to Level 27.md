After breaking into the Bandit26 shell using the method from the previous level, the home directory reveals a file named **bandit27-do**, which is a small wrapper allowing commands to be executed as user _bandit27_, similar to the setuid-style helper encountered in earlier levels. Running it without arguments shows that it simply takes any command and executes it as the higher-privileged user. Since we only need the next password, we directly use this helper to read `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27` by running `./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`, which prints the password: `3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea`
