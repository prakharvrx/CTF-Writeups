You begin this level by creating a temporary workspace using `mktemp -d` and then moving into that folder with `cd`. Inside this directory, you clone the target Git repository by running `git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo`, and once the cloning is complete, you enter the `repo` directory. Listing the contents with `ls -la` shows only a `.git` directory and a `README.md` file. When you view the README using `cat README.md`, it simply states “just an empty file… muahaha”, giving no useful information. Since nothing is on the main branch, you check for Git tags using `git tag`, which reveals a single tag named `secret`. Because tags often mark important commits, you inspect this tag with `git show secret`, and this command displays the hidden password for the next level: `47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5`.
