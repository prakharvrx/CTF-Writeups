You start by creating a fresh working directory using `mktemp -d` and moving into it with `cd`. Inside this temporary folder, you clone the target repository by running `git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo`, and once the cloning finishes, you enter the `repo` directory. Listing the files with `ls -la` shows a `.gitignore` file, a `.git` directory, and a `README.md`. Reading the README using `cat README.md` explains that your task is to _push_ a file named `key.txt` containing the text `May I come in?` to the `master` branch of the remote repo. So you create that file with `echo 'May I come in?' > key.txt`, and confirm it with `cat key.txt`. When you try to commit normally, it fails because `.gitignore` contains the pattern `*.txt`, meaning Git will ignore all `.txt` files. To override this, you forcibly stage the file using `git add -f key.txt`, then commit it with `git commit -a` (ignoring nano warnings), and finally push the commit to the remote repository using `git push -u origin master`. After the push, the remote hook validates the change and prints the next password: `56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e`.
