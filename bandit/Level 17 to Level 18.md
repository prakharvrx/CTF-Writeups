To solve Bandit Level 17 to 18, simply compare the two files using `diff passwords.old passwords.new`; the output will show which line has changed. In this case, it shows `42c42`, meaning line 42 is different. The line marked with `<` comes from the first file (passwords.old) and the line marked with `>` comes from the second file (passwords.new). Because we placed `passwords.new` in the second position of the diff command, the value shown with `>` is the new and correct password: `kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd`.
