To solve Bandit Level 22 to 23, we first check `/etc/cron.d` and find a cron job named `cronjob_bandit23`, which runs a script (`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh`) every minute as user bandit23. Reading the script shows that it uses two variables: `myname`, which stores the output of `whoami` (so it becomes `bandit23` when the cron runs), and `mytarget`, which is an MD5 hash generated from the string “I am user bandit23”. The script then copies the password of user bandit23 into `/tmp/$mytarget`. To retrieve the file name, we simply run `echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1`, which gives `8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349`. Using `cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349` reveals the password for the next level: `jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n`.
