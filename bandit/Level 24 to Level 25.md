To solve Bandit Level 24 → 25, we connect to the daemon on port 30002 with `nc localhost 30002` and observe that it expects the Bandit24 password plus a 4-digit PIN, rejecting wrong attempts with the same single-line response. Since the PIN cannot be known, we brute-force all 10,000 combinations by generating every possibility using a simple bash loop from `{0000..9999}` and appending each “password pincode” pair into a file. Then we pipe this list into netcat and save the server’s responses. After running the script, filtering the output with `grep -v "Wrong"` removes all failed attempts, leaving only the successful response. That output reveals the correct PIN along with the password for the next level: **uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG**.
