The correct way to solve this level is to first log in using `ssh bandit27@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`. After entering the password, create a temporary working directory with `mktemp -d` and move into it using `cd /tmp/<foldername>`. Inside this directory, clone the given git repository by running `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`, and when prompted, provide the same password as bandit27. Once the cloning finishes, go into the repository using `cd repo` and list its contents with `ls -la`, where you will notice a `.git` directory and a README file. Since the README is the only file, display its contents using `cat README`, which prints the next level’s password: `0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2`
