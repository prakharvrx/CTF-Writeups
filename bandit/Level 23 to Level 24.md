To solve Bandit Level 23 → 24, we inspect `/etc/cron.d` and find that `cronjob_bandit24` runs `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh` every minute as user bandit24. Reading the script shows that it enters `/var/spool/bandit24` and executes any file inside it **only if the owner is bandit23**, then deletes it. Since we are logged in as bandit23, we can exploit this by placing our own script there. We create a temporary working directory with `mktemp -d`, then inside it write a small script (`bandit24_pass.sh`) that simply outputs bandit24’s password into a file:  
`#!/bin/bash`  
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/<dirname>/password`  
After that, we make the script executable (`chmod +rx bandit24_pass.sh`) and ensure the temp folder and output file have full permissions. Finally, we copy the script into `/var/spool/bandit24/` and wait for cron to execute it. After one minute, reading the output file with `cat password` reveals the next password: `UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ`
