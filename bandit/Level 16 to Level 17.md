To solve Bandit Level 16 to 17, first connect using `ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`, then scan ports 31000–32000 with `nmap -p31000-32000 -sV localhost` to identify which port accepts SSL (usually 31790). After finding the SSL-enabled port, connect to it using `openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790`; a long certificate will appear, which is normal. When the connection stays open, type the Bandit16 password `kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx` and press Enter. The server will return an RSA private key for Bandit17—copy it and save it to a file such as `/tmp/band17.key` using a text editor, then run `chmod 600 /tmp/band17.key` to fix permissions. Finally, log in to Bandit17 using `ssh -i /tmp/band17.key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.
