To solve Bandit Level 19 to 20, we inspect the home directory and find a setuid binary named `bandit20-do`. Using `ls -la`, we see it is owned by `bandit20` and has the permission `-rwsr-x---`, which means that when we execute it as bandit19, it actually runs with bandit20’s privileges. Running the binary without arguments shows it can execute any command as user bandit20. Using this, we simply run `./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20`, which allows us to read the next level’s password even though only bandit20 normally has access. The command returns the password: `GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j`.
