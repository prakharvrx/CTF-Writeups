After logging into bandit32 using `ssh -p 2220 bandit32@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` with the password `56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e`, you immediately notice that the shell behaves strangely—every command like `ls` or `cd` gets converted into uppercase and fails. After trying the usual commands with no success, you check what shell you're actually running by typing `$0`, and surprisingly, it drops you into a real bash shell. Once inside bash, you can finally run `ls` normally and see the files available. From there, you simply read the final password using `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`, which gives access to the last level. Logging in as bandit33 shows a `README.txt` with a message congratulating you for completing the final level of the Bandit wargame and informing you that no further levels exist yet, though more may be added in the future.
