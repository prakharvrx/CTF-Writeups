To access Bandit26, we first identify its login shell via `/etc/passwd`, which shows that instead of `/bin/bash`, the user is forced into `/usr/bin/showtext`, a script that sets `TERM=linux` and opens `text.txt` using `more`, then exits. When logging in with the provided private SSH key, the script runs immediately and closes the session because the file is short, so `more` never enters interactive mode. To break out, we deliberately shrink the terminal window before logging in, forcing `more` into interactive mode; pressing **v** opens the file in **vim** as user _bandit26_. From inside vim, we can either open the password file directly with `:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26` or spawn a real shell. Since vim’s `:shell` normally uses the restricted default shell, we first change it to bash using `:set shell=/bin/bash` and then run `:shell` to get a proper interactive shell as bandit26. Once inside, we simply read the password from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`, which is `5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z`
