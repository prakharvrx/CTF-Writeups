To solve Bandit Level 18 to 19, we must bypass the modified `.bashrc` file, which logs us out instantly when we SSH normally. Since `.bashrc` runs only when an interactive shell starts, we avoid triggering it by executing a command directly through SSH. Using `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ls` confirms that the file `readme` exists in the home directory, and then `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme` allows us to read the password without ever entering a full shell. This returns the next level’s password: `IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x`. Alternatively, instead of reading the file directly, we could force a non-interactive shell using `/bin/bash` or create a pseudo-terminal with `-t` to run `/bin/sh`, both of which bypass `.bashrc` and allow normal command execution.
