This challenge requires basic knowledge of command-line tools to find a hidden password and a flag. The core idea is to find hidden files and directories that are not visible with a simple `ls` command.

## Step 1: Initial Investigation

The first step is to download and unzip the provided file, `The Flag.zip`. This reveals two directories: `__MACOSX` and `The Flag`. We can disregard the `__MACOSX` directory as it is typically used for macOS-specific metadata.

## Step 2: Finding Hidden Files

Navigate into the `The Flag` directory. A standard `ls` command will show only one file, `The Flag.pdf`, which is password-protected. To find any hidden files or directories, we must use the `ls -al` command, which lists all files, including those that start with a period (`.`).

```
total 40
drwxr-xr-x 3 rishit rishit  4096 Oct 30  2016  .
drwxr-xr-x 4 rishit rishit  4096 Jul 10 16:13  ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 rishit rishit  6148 Oct 30  2016  .DS_Store
-rw-r--r-- 1 rishit rishit 16647 Oct 30  2016 'The Flag.pdf'
drwxr-xr-x 2 rishit rishit  4096 Oct 30  2016  .ThePassword
```

The output reveals a hidden directory named `.ThePassword`. This is the key to finding the password.

## Step 3: Retrieving the Password

Next, we need to enter the `.ThePassword` directory and list its contents.

```
cd .ThePassword
ls
```

The `ls` command shows a file named `ThePassword.txt`. We can use the `cat` command to view the contents of this text file.

```
cat ThePassword.txt
```

The output of the `cat` command reveals the password: "Im The Flag".

## Step 4: Unlocking the Flag

Finally, we can use the retrieved password to unlock the `The Flag.pdf` file. Opening the PDF with the password `"Im The Flag"` reveals the final flag hidden inside.

The flag is:

**ABCTF{T3Rm1n4l_is_C00l}**

This challenge demonstrates how important it is to look for hidden files, which are a common technique in many CTF challenges.
