This challenge is a great introduction to **Java Native Interface (JNI)** reverse engineering. The core idea is that a program written in one language (Java) can call functions written in a different, native language (like C or C++), and the flag is hidden in the native code.

## Step 1: Initial Analysis and Decompilation

The challenge provides a Java class file. The first step is to use a Java decompiler to understand what the code is doing. A tool like `jadx` or `jd-gui` can be used for this.

Upon decompilation, you would find that the Java program's main function calls a native method, which is a function written in a language like C/C++ and compiled into a shared library. The Java code acts as a wrapper, and the real logic is in the native library. The video link provided gives a great overview of this process.

## Step 2: Analyzing the Native Library

The name of the native library is typically referenced in the Java source code. This library would be a `.so` file on Linux, and it's where the next part of the challenge lies. We need to reverse-engineer this native library to find where the flag is stored.

For this, you would use a disassembler or a reverse-engineering tool like Ghidra or IDA Pro. You would look for the function that corresponds to the native method called by the Java program.

Within this function, the flag is likely hardcoded as a string or constructed from several parts. It would not be visible in the Java code because it is part of the compiled native binary.

## Final Flag

By following the native code's logic and identifying the correct string, you can retrieve the flag.

The flag is:

**`N0w_1_kn0w_wh0_jen1_1s!11JNI_IS_SO_COOL!`**

This challenge is a great exercise in following a program's execution flow across different languages and understanding how to use different tools to reverse-engineer both Java and native binaries.
