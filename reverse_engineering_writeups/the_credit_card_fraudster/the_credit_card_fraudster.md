This challenge requires **Android reverse engineering** and a bit of **cryptography** knowledge. The goal is to decompile an Android application package (`.apk` file) to find the logic that validates the user's input, and then reverse the hash to find the correct password and the flag.

## Step 1: Decompiling the APK

The first step is to decompile the provided `.apk` file. While many tools can be used for this, you can often use an online decompiler to quickly get the source code. Once decompiled, we need to locate the main application logic, which is typically in the `MainActivity.java` file. This file contains the code that handles user input and validates the password.

The decompiled `MainActivity.java` reveals the following critical piece of code:

```
public void submitPassword(View view) {
    EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(C0272R.C0274id.editText2);
    if (DigestUtils.md5Hex(editText.getText().toString()).equalsIgnoreCase("b74dec4f39d35b6a2e6c48e637c8aedb")) {
        TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(C0272R.C0274id.textView);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("Success! CTFlearn{");
        sb.append(editText.getText().toString());
        sb.append("_is_not_secure!}");
        textView.setText(sb.toString());
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Reversing the MD5 Hash

The decompiled code shows that the application takes the text from an input field, computes its **MD5 hash**, and compares it to a hardcoded string: `b74dec4f39d35b6a2e6c48e637c8aedb`. The flag is then constructed using the original plaintext password.

To get the flag, we need to find the original string that produces this specific MD5 hash. Since MD5 is a one-way function, we cannot simply "un-hash" it. However, because it's a common hash, we can use an online MD5 decryption service, also known as a **rainbow table lookup**.

By searching for the hash `b74dec4f39d35b6a2e6c48e637c8aedb` on an online service like `md5online.org`, we can find the original plaintext string.

The service reveals that the plaintext is: **`Spring2019`**.

## Step 3: Constructing the Final Flag

Now that we have the plaintext password, we can use it to construct the final flag. The `MainActivity.java` file shows exactly how the flag is built:

`"Success! CTFlearn{" + editText.getText().toString() + "_is_not_secure!}"`

By substituting the `editText` content with our cracked password, we get the final flag.

The final flag is:

**`CTFlearn{Spring2019_is_not_secure!}`**
